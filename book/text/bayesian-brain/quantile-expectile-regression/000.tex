Distributional Reinforcement Learning in the Brainに
> Quantile-like codes are non-parametric codes, as they do not a priori assume a specific form of a probability distribution with associated parameters. Previous studies have proposed different population coding schemes. For example, probabilistic population codes (PPCs) [73,74] and distributed distributional codes (DDCs) [75,76] employ population coding schemes from which various statistical parameters of a distribution can be read out, making them parametric codes. As a simple example, a PPC might encode a Gaussian distribution, in which case the mean would be reflected in which specific neurons are most active, and the variance would be reflected in the inverse of the overall activity [73].
