% \subsection{Environments for Indented Text}
%
% \DescribeEnv{indentation}
% The indentation environment allows us to temporarily reset the margins.
% This environment takes two arguments, which are the left and right indents.
% Usually either both will be the same (for a centered indent) or else
% the right indent will be 0pt (for left indent only).
%
% Examples:
%
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \begin{indentation}{1.5em}{1.5em}
%   This text will be set in a justified paragraph with narrower
%   margins than usual.  The paragraph will be indented 1.5em on
%   each side from the surrounding margins.
%   \end{indentation}
%
%   \begin{indentation}{.5in}{0pt}
%   This text will be set in a justified paragraph indented at
%   the left but not the right.
%   \end{indentation}
%
%
%   \begin{indentation}{1.5em}{1.5em}
%   This text will be indented.
%   \begin{indentation}{1.5em}{1.5em}
%   The indentation environment can be nested, giving indents
%   within indents, so this text will be indented some more.
%   \end{indentation}
%   Now we return to the first indentation level.
%   \end{indentation}
% \end{verbatim}
%
% The method of margin-changing implemented here is identical to that
% used by \LaTeX's "list" environment.  Indeed, this code was written
% by making a copy of the "list" environment's code, studying it closely,
% and carefully paring out everything that didn't relate to setting margins.
% This means that if another
% environment (such as "center" or "quote") that uses the "list" environment
% is nested inside the "indentation" environment, or if an "indentation"
% environment is used inside a "list" environment, everything should
% work just fine.
%
% \begin{macro}{\indentation}
% The "indentation" environment begins and ends by executing "\par".
% The first one guarantees that a paragraph that began before the
% environment will not be affected by the new margins the environment
% sets up, and that the last paragraph inside the environment will be.
% The code for resetting the margins uses "\parshape" to maintain the
% modified margin settings, rather than using "\leftskip" and "\rightskip".
% This is rather clever, since it leaves us free to use the skip values
% to produce other special effects (such as centering or ragged right).
% But because \TeX\ normally resets "\parshape" declarations at the
% end of each paragraph, we redefine "\par" to perform its usual
% actions {\em inside a group}.  The group is opened, "\@@par" ends
% the paragraph, the "\parshape" setting is canceled {\em within the
% group}, and the group ends, restoring the "\parshape" setting.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\newenvironment{indentation}[2]%
{%
  \par
  \setlength{\leftmargin}{#1}%
  \setlength{\rightmargin}{#2}%
  \advance\linewidth -\leftmargin
  \advance\linewidth -\rightmargin
  \advance\@totalleftmargin\leftmargin
  \@setpar{{\@@par}}%
  \parshape 1 \@totalleftmargin \linewidth
  \ignorespaces
  \setlength{\parindent}{1zw}%%%%%195718-add
}%
{\par}
%    \end{macrocode}
% An earlier version of this code used the "list" environment directly.
% Using the "indentation" environment actually caused a "list" environment
% with one item to be created.  The formatting parameters for the "list"
% environment were set to make the list appear just like the surrounding
% text, except for the margin change.  That is, "\topsep" was given
% the value "0pt", "\parsep" was set to "\parskip", and "\listparindent"
% and "\itemindent" were both set to "\parindent".  This worked tolerably
% well as a first approximation, but ultimately it was unsatisfactory for
% several reasons, the most important being that an empty "list" environment
% generates a \LaTeX\ error ("\@noitemerr", to be specific).  Instead of
% choosing special values and writing extra code to overcome the setup
% that the "list" environment performs that isn't needed for our purposes,
% I finally decided to simply figure out how the "list" environment resets
% margins and re-implement just that part in the "indentation" environment.
% \end{macro}
%
% \DescribeEnv{ctrindent}
% The ctrindent environment uses the indentation environment
% (defined above) and the standard "\centering" declaration to typeset
% centered text in reduced margins.  This environment takes two
% arguments, which are the left and right indents.  Usually
% both will be the same, but in principle you could have a paragraph
% whose lines were centered around a point that was off-center with
% respect to the surrounding column of text.
%
% Example:
%
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \begin{ctrindent}{.5in}{.5in}
%   This text will be set in a centered paragraph with narrower
%   margins than usual.
%   \end{ctrindent}
% \end{verbatim}
%
% \begin{macro}{\ctrindent}
% The "\ctrindent" environment is just an "indentation" environment
% inside which a "\centering" declaration is in effect.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\newenvironment{ctrindent}[2]%
{\begin{indentation}{#1}{#2}\centering}%
{\end{indentation}}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
