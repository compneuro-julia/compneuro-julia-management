               the brain, the cerebral cortex, contains columns of cells with
               similar properties. This led to the development of the pinwheel
               model, which describes how these columns are organized. The
               latest refinement to this model comes from a mathematical study,
               which shows that the pinwheel model is subject to stringent
               symmetry principles.",
