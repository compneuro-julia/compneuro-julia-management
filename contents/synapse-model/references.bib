  abstract = "Transmission across neocortical synapses depends on the frequency
              of presynaptic activity (Thomson \& Deuchars, 1994).
              Interpyramidal synapses in layer V exhibit fast depression of
              synaptic transmission, while other types of synapses exhibit
              facilitation of transmission. To study the role of dynamic
              synapses in network computation, we propose a unified
              phenomenological model that allows computation of the
              postsynaptic current generated by both types of synapses when
              driven by an arbitrary pattern of action potential (AP) activity
              in a presynaptic population. Using this formalism, we analyze
              different regimes of synaptic transmission and demonstrate that
              dynamic synapses transmit different aspects of the presynaptic
              activity depending on the average presynaptic frequency. The
              model also allows for derivation of mean-field equations, which
              govern the activity of large, interconnected networks. We show
              that the dynamics of synaptic transmission results in complex
              sets of regular and irregular regimes of network activity.",

               strength has been proposed to subserve learning and memory by
               changing the gain of signals conveyed between neurons1,2. Here
               we examine synaptic plasticity between individual neocortical
               layer-5 pyramidal neurons. We show that an increase in the
               synaptic response, induced by pairing action-potential activity
               in pre- and postsynaptic neurons, was only observed when
               synaptic input occurred at low frequencies. This
               frequency-dependent increase in synaptic responses arises
               because of a redistribution of the available synaptic efficacy
               and not because of an increase in the efficacy. Redistribution
               of synaptic efficacy could represent a mechanism to change the
               content, rather than the gain, of signals conveyed between
               neurons.",

  title    = "Synaptic depression and cortical gain control",
  author   = "Abbott, L F and Varela, J A and Sen, K and Nelson, S B",
  abstract = "Cortical neurons receive synaptic inputs from thousands of
              afferents that fire action potentials at rates ranging from less
              than 1 hertz to more than 200 hertz. Both the number of afferents
              and their large dynamic range can mask changes in the spatial and
              temporal pattern of synaptic activity, limiting the ability of a
              cortical neuron to respond to its inputs. Modeling work based on
              experimental measurements indicates that short-term depression of
              intracortical synapses provides a dynamic gain-control mechanism
              that allows equal percentage rate changes on rapidly and slowly
              firing afferents to produce equal postsynaptic responses. Unlike
              inhibitory and adaptive mechanisms that reduce responsiveness to
              all inputs, synaptic depression is input-specific, leading to a
              dramatic increase in the sensitivity of a neuron to subtle
              changes in the firing patterns of its afferents.",

  title     = "The neural code between neocortical pyramidal neurons depends on
               neurotransmitter release probability",
  author    = "Tsodyks, Misha V and Markram, Henry",
  abstract  = "Although signaling between neurons is central to the functioning
               of the brain, we still do not understand how the code used in
               signaling depends on the properties of synaptic transmission.
               Theoretical analysis combined with patch clamp recordings from
               pairs of neocortical pyramidal neurons revealed that the rate of
               synaptic depression, which depends on the probability of
               neurotransmitter release, dictates the extent to which firing
               rate and temporal coherence of action potentials within a
               presynaptic population are signaled to the postsynaptic neuron.
               The postsynaptic response primarily reflects rates of firing
               when depression is slow and temporal coherence when depression
               is fast. A wide range of rates of synaptic depression between
               different pairs of pyramidal neurons was found, suggesting that
               the relative contribution of rate and temporal signals varies
               along a continuum. We conclude that by setting the rate of
               synaptic depression, release probability is an important factor
               in determining the neural code.",

              the presynaptic residual calcium is used as a buffer that is
              loaded, refreshed, and read out by spiking activity. Because of
              the long time constants of calcium kinetics, the refresh rate can
              be low, resulting in a mechanism that is metabolically efficient
              and robust. The duration and stability of working memory can be
              regulated by modulating the spontaneous activity in the network.",
