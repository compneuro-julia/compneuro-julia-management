              relationships between these maps provide clues to the strategies
              the cortex uses for representing and processing information. Here
              we simulate the combined development of all these map systems
              using a computational model, the elastic net. We show that this
              model robustly produces combined maps of these four variables
              that bear a close resemblance to experimental maps. In addition
              we show that the experimentally observed effects of monocular
              deprivation and single-orientation rearing can be reproduced in
              this model, and we make some testable predictions. These results
              provide strong support for the hypothesis that cortical
              representations attempt to optimize a trade-off between coverage
              and continuity.",

               the structure of complex data sets in terms of topological
               descriptors, such as persistence diagrams. While there are many
               powerful techniques for computing topological descriptors, the
               inverse problem, i.e., recovering the input data from
               topological descriptors, has proved to be challenging. In this
               article, we study in detail the Topological Morphology
               Descriptor (TMD), which assigns a persistence diagram to any
               tree embedded in Euclidean space, and a sort of stochastic
               inverse to the TMD, the Topological Neuron Synthesis (TNS)
               algorithm, gaining both theoretical and computational insights
               into the relation between the two. We propose a new approach to
               classify barcodes using symmetric groups, which provides a

               what extent the TNS recovers a geometric tree from its TMD and
               describe the effect of different types of noise on the process

               revealing the mechanical origin of the brain's folded geometry.
               The rapid growth of the human cortex during development is
               accompanied by the folding of the brain into a highly convoluted
               structure1,2,3. Recent studies have focused on the genetic and
               cellular regulation of cortical growth4,5,6,7,8, but
               understanding the formation of the gyral and sulcal convolutions
               also requires consideration of the geometry and physical shaping
               of the growing brain9,10,11,12,13,14,15. To study this, we use
               magnetic resonance images to build a 3D-printed layered gel
               mimic of the developing smooth fetal brain; when immersed in a
               solvent, the outer layer swells relative to the core, mimicking
               cortical growth. This relative growth puts the outer layer into
               mechanical compression and leads to sulci and gyri similar to
               those in fetal brains. Starting with the same initial geometry,
               we also build numerical simulations of the brain modelled as a
               soft tissue with a growing cortex, and show that this also
               produces the characteristic patterns of convolutions over a
               realistic developmental course. All together, our results show
               that although many molecular determinants control the tangential
               expansion of the cortex, the size, shape, placement and
               orientation of the folds arise through iterations and variations
               of an elementary mechanical instability modulated by early fetal
               brain geometry.",
